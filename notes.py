 and positioning the mics away from the instruments will give you a natural sound whereas clipons become really difficult to sound natural. 

the sound was sort of out of tune.

 the comb effect? The 3:1 rule? Something like that?

any phase problems or any other problems arising from using two mics for the same source?

string group will generally sound more in tune at a distance than it does inside the section. Going close and loosing blend will highlight any pitch issues.

The DPA 4061

 I fill in with the spots using reverb to blend. 

When I'm running an orchestral rig with omnis hanging 8-10 feet overhead, the first thing I do is find my point where it feeds back. Then I make sure I never go over that point. 

you can't mike an orchestra like you would for a recording and then put it through a pa, it just won't work

he said that it should be viewed as a Sound Rienforcement job, rather than a PA job. 

they were not able to hear themselves as well as when they were in rehearsal, perhaps the PA level was so high it was interferring with what they were hearing.
DPA 4060's, 4099's are good ways to go and can produce good results, miking with condensers 1 per desk is usually better 


 susceptible to wind noise


with ringing out monitors, yes, you can get them to go incredibly loud, but they sound awful.


Live orchestral sound is always going to be a compromise,

Also, some technician thinks that classical music must always sound like the famous Carmina Burana bit and that's what they are looking for in any concert no matter what. "Classical music" is just so wide and so varied that we have to be aware as technicians of those differences and have the musical background for not working sound in the same way if you are doing Gershwin, that if you are doing some Italian baroque music, Schubert or some weird contemporary XXth century composer. It can be just so different!! Nowadays, the amount of music produced is huge, but there's so much interesting music in the previous twenty centuries!
